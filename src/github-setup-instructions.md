# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Since I cannot directly create GitHub repositories, here are the complete instructions to set up your Magdee repository on GitHub.

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Fill in repository details:**
   - Repository name: `magdee-pdf-to-audio`
   - Description: `Magdee - PDF to Audio conversion app with React frontend and Python FastAPI backend`
   - Make it **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
   - **Check** "Add a README file"
   - **Check** "Add .gitignore" and select "Node"
   - **Check** "Choose a license" and select "MIT License"

### 2. Clone and Setup Local Repository

```bash
# Clone your new repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/magdee-pdf-to-audio.git
cd magdee-pdf-to-audio

# Verify you're in the right directory
pwd
```

### 3. Copy All Project Files

Copy all your project files into the cloned repository directory. Your structure should look like this:

```
magdee-pdf-to-audio/
â”œâ”€â”€ .env.example           # âœ… Copy this
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore            # âœ… Already exists from GitHub
â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx               # âœ… Copy this
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json          # âœ… Copy this
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # âœ… Replace with your detailed version
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE               # âœ… Already exists from GitHub
â”œâ”€â”€ CONTRIBUTING.md       # âœ… Copy this
â”œâ”€â”€ components/           # âœ… Copy entire folder
â”œâ”€â”€ app/                  # âœ… Copy entire folder
â”œâ”€â”€ supabase/            # âœ… Copy entire folder
â”œâ”€â”€ services/            # âœ… Copy entire folder
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/               # âœ… Copy entire folder
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/               # âœ… Copy entire folder
â”œâ”€â”€ types/               # âœ… Copy entire folder
â”œâ”€â”€ constants/           # âœ… Copy entire folder
â”œâ”€â”€ styles/              # âœ… Copy entire folder
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt     # âœ… Copy this
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py             # âœ… Copy this
â””â”€â”€ (all other files)   # âœ… Copy everything
```

### 4. Initialize Git and Commit Files

```bash
# Check git status
git status

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "feat: initial commit with complete Magdee app

- React frontend with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Python FastAPI backend with PDF processing
- Supabase integration for database and auth
- Complete UI/UX with mobile-first design
- Audio player with reading synchronization
- User management and profile features
- Performance optimizations and error handling
- Comprehensive documentation and setup guides"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### 5. Setup Repository Settings

#### 5.1 Enable GitHub Pages (Optional)
1. Go to repository Settings
2. Scroll to "Pages" section
3. Select source: "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select branch: "main" and folder: "/ (root)"
5. Save

#### 5.2 Add Repository Topics
1. Go to your repository main page
2. Click the gear icon next to "About"
3. Add topics: `pdf-to-audio`, `react`, `typescript`, `python`, `fastapi`, `supabase`, `mobile-app`, `audio-conversion`

#### 5.3 Setup Branch Protection (Recommended)
1. Go to Settings â†’ Branches
2. Add rule for "main" branch
3. Enable:
   - Require a pull request before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require branches to be up to date before merging

### 6. Setup GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

Create workflow files for automated testing and deployment:

```bash
# Create GitHub Actions directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

Create the workflow files:

#### Frontend CI Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml
name: Frontend CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [16.x, 18.x]
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false
    
    - name: Build application
      run: npm run build
    
    - name: Upload coverage reports
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
      with:
        file: ./coverage/lcov.info
        flags: frontend
        name: frontend-coverage
```

#### Backend CI Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/backend-ci.yml
name: Backend CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, '3.10']
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pip install pytest pytest-cov
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest --cov=app tests/
    
    - name: Upload coverage reports
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
      with:
        file: ./coverage.xml
        flags: backend
        name: backend-coverage
```

### 7. Add Repository Secrets

For CI/CD and deployment, add these secrets in Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions:

```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### 8. Create Issue Templates

```bash
# Create issue templates directory
mkdir -p .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE
```

#### Bug Report Template
