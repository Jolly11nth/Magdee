# Placeholder Images Info

## Current Status

This folder currently uses Unsplash placeholders. Replace these with your actual Magdee brand assets.

## Required Files

1. **magdee-logo.png** - Main Magdee logo
2. **magdee-logo-variant.png** - Alternative logo (can be same as main)
3. **empty-state.png** - Empty state illustration

## Temporary Placeholders

Until you add your actual images, the app uses:
- ImageWithFallback component with Unsplash fallbacks
- Blue-themed placeholder images matching Magdee's color scheme

## Next Steps

1. Export your logo and illustrations from Figma
2. Place them in this folder with the exact names listed above
3. The app will automatically use your images
4. Delete this file once migration is complete
