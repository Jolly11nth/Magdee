# üöÇ Railway Deployment Guide

Complete guide to deploy Magdee Python backend to Railway.

---

## üìã Prerequisites

- ‚úÖ Railway account ([railway.app](https://railway.app))
- ‚úÖ GitHub repository with Magdee code
- ‚úÖ Supabase project setup
- ‚úÖ API keys (ElevenLabs, OpenAI)

---

## üöÄ Quick Deploy (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install Railway CLI

```bash
# macOS/Linux
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Or using Homebrew (macOS)
brew install railway
```

### Step 2: Login to Railway

```bash
railway login
```

This opens your browser for authentication.

### Step 3: Initialize Project

```bash
# In your project root directory
railway init
```

Select:
- **Create a new project**
- **Choose a name:** `magdee-python-backend`

### Step 4: Link GitHub Repository (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# Link to existing GitHub repo
railway link

# Or deploy from GitHub
# 1. Go to https://railway.app/new
# 2. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
# 3. Select your magdee repository
```

### Step 5: Set Environment Variables

```bash
# Required variables
railway variables set SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
railway variables set SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
railway variables set SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
railway variables set ENVIRONMENT=production
railway variables set DEBUG=false
railway variables set FRONTEND_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend.vercel.app
railway variables set ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_key
railway variables set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key

# Optional but recommended
railway variables set LOG_LEVEL=INFO
railway variables set RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=60
railway variables set RATE_LIMIT_PER_HOUR=1000
```

### Step 6: Deploy

```bash
railway up
```

That's it! Railway will:
- ‚úÖ Build your Docker container
- ‚úÖ Set the PORT automatically
- ‚úÖ Deploy your application
- ‚úÖ Provide a public URL

### Step 7: Get Your URL

```bash
# Get deployment URL
railway status

# Or open in browser
railway open
```

Your backend is now live at: `https://magdee-python-backend.up.railway.app`

## üîç Verification

### Check Deployment Status

```bash
# View deployment status
railway status

# View logs
railway logs

# Follow logs in real-time
railway logs --follow
```

### Test Endpoints

```bash
# Get your Railway URL
RAILWAY_URL=$(railway status --json | jq -r '.deployments[0].domain')

# Test health check
curl https://$RAILWAY_URL/api/health

# Or manually
curl https://magdee-python-backend.up.railway.app/api/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": 1234567890,
  "environment": "production",
  "services": {
    "pdf_processing": "operational",
    "audio_conversion": "operational",
    "analytics": "operational"
  }
}
```

### Test API Documentation

Visit: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/docs`

You should see interactive API documentation.

## üåê Update Frontend

After deploying to Railway, update your frontend:

### Vercel

```bash
# Set environment variable
vercel env add VITE_PYTHON_BACKEND_URL production

# Enter: https://your-app.up.railway.app

# Redeploy
vercel --prod
```

### Netlify

1. Go to **Site settings** ‚Üí **Environment variables**
2. Add `VITE_PYTHON_BACKEND_URL`
3. Value: `https://your-app.up.railway.app`
4. Trigger redeploy

### Local `.env`

Update `.env` for testing:
```bash
VITE_PYTHON_BACKEND_URL=https://your-app.up.railway.app
```

---

## üìä Monitoring & Logs

### View Logs

```bash
# Recent logs
railway logs

# Follow logs (real-time)
railway logs --follow

# Filter logs
railway logs | grep ERROR

# Export logs
railway logs > logs.txt
```

### Metrics Dashboard

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Select your project
3. View **Metrics** tab:
   - CPU usage
   - Memory usage
   - Network traffic
   - Request count

### Alerts (Pro Plan)

Set up alerts for:
- High CPU usage
- High memory usage
- Deployment failures
- Health check failures

---

## üîÑ Updates & Rollbacks

### Deploy Updates

```bash
# Deploy latest code
railway up

# Deploy specific commit
git checkout <commit-hash>
railway up
```

### Rollback

```bash
# List deployments
railway deployments

# Rollback to specific deployment
railway rollback <deployment-id>
```

### Zero-Downtime Deployment

Railway automatically does zero-downtime deployments:
1. Builds new version
2. Starts new container
3. Waits for health check
4. Routes traffic to new version
5. Shuts down old version

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Deployment Fails

**Check logs:**
```bash
railway logs
```

**Common issues:**

1. **Missing environment variables**
   ```bash
   railway variables
   # Verify all required variables are set
   ```

2. **Dockerfile build fails**
   ```bash
   # Test locally
   docker build -t test .
   ```

3. **Port binding issues**
   - Ensure app reads `PORT` from environment
   - Ensure app binds to `0.0.0.0`

### Health Check Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Deployment shows as unhealthy
- Traffic not routed to app

**Solutions:**

1. **Check health endpoint:**
   ```bash
   railway logs | grep health
   ```

2. **Verify endpoint exists:**
   ```python
   @app.get("/api/health")
   async def health_check():
       return {"status": "healthy"}
   ```

3. **Update railway.json:**
   ```json
   {
     "deploy": {
       "healthcheckPath": "/api/health",
       "healthcheckTimeout": 100
     }
   }
   ```

### Application Crashes

**Check logs:**
```bash
railway logs --follow
```

**Common causes:**

1. **Missing dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Ensure requirements.txt is complete
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Environment variable issues:**
   ```bash
   railway variables
   # Check all required vars are set
   ```

3. **Memory issues:**
   - Upgrade plan for more RAM
   - Optimize memory usage

### CORS Errors

**Update CORS origins in production:**

```python
# app/config.py
@property
def cors_origins(self) -> List[str]:
    if self.environment == "production":
        return [
            self.frontend_origin,
            "https://your-actual-domain.com"
        ]
```

**Set FRONTEND_ORIGIN:**
```bash
railway variables set FRONTEND_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend.vercel.app
```

### Slow Performance

**Solutions:**

1. **Check metrics** in Railway dashboard
2. **Upgrade plan** for more resources
3. **Optimize code:**
   - Add caching
   - Optimize database queries
   - Use async operations

---

## üîê Security Best Practices

### 1. Environment Variables

- ‚úÖ Never commit `.env` files
- ‚úÖ Use Railway's variable management
- ‚úÖ Rotate keys regularly
- ‚ùå Don't hardcode secrets

### 2. Service Role Key

```bash
# Keep service role key secure
railway variables set SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=xxx --secret
```

### 3. CORS Configuration

```bash
# Only allow your frontend
railway variables set FRONTEND_ORIGIN=https://your-app.vercel.app
```

### 4. Rate Limiting

```bash
# Set appropriate limits
railway variables set RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=60
railway variables set RATE_LIMIT_PER_HOUR=1000
```

---

## üìà Scaling

### Vertical Scaling

Upgrade to higher tier for:
- More RAM
- More CPU
- Better performance

```bash
# Check current usage
railway metrics
```

### Horizontal Scaling (Pro Plan)

Railway supports:
- Multiple instances
- Auto-scaling
- Load balancing
